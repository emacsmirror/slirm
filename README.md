# Systematic Literature Review Mode for Emacs #

A little helper to dig through BibTeX files generated by a search
query. Planned features:

- Annotating BibTeX entries whether to keep or to remove.
- Try to download and show PDF for each entry on-demand and cache it
  locally.
- Display abstract if available.
- Entry categorization.
- Nice presentation of each entry in a separate buffer.

Annotating should be easy to integrate with Git to support working in
groups. Currently, I am really only building this for myself.
